A message editor for SMG1.

Not done yet.  So far, it will create an XML from `message.bmg` and `messageid.tbl`, which you can extract from `Message.arc`.  Just use the path to your `message.bmg` as the first command-line parameter.

Now I need to make a script that will convert back from the XML file, as well as figure out if the FLW1 section in `message.bmg` is of much importance.
