A message editor for SMG1.

`msg2xml.py` will convert a valid Super Mario Galaxy 1 message BMG file into a more easily editable XML file.

`xml2msg.py` does the opposite, and creates a Super Mario Galaxy 1 message BMG file from an XML file.

At the moment, _please do not add entries to the XML file!_ This program does not edit `messageid.tbl` and thus can _not_ properly handle additional messages.  (I'll add that in later!)

If you need to know a name or identifier for any particular thing (color, emoji, whatever), check the files in the CSV folder. You can also edit these to your liking.
