A message editor for SMG1.

Not done yet.  So far, it will create an XML from `message.bmg` and `messageid.tbl`, which you can extract from `Message.arc`.  At the moment, they both have to be in the same folder as the script and its `.csv` files.

I've still got a few binary IDs to program in in order to prevent loss of data on reconversion, which is not possible at all yet.  Also, there's some funky properties all over the place that I still need to convert into the XML.
